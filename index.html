Those two pillars will help validate the idea.</li>

                     <li><b>Impact.</b> Our theme this year is to create a solution that will help improve the betterment of the DMV community. In this category we are looking for key factors that shows how the team's idea is scalable and give a clear measure as to how thier solution makes an impact on the user's life.</li>

                     <li><b>Technical.</b> In the midst of the given 24 hours the judges will be looking for an established minimum viable product and a working prototype . This can range from a web application, mobile application or an IoT.</li>

                     <li><b>Design and User Experience.</b> The teams final minimum viable product and prototype should achieve an engaging and memorable user experience. This means having a clear interface that is intuitive for users that come from different backgrounds.</li>

                     <li><b>Presentation.</b> Teams will be rated base off presentation layout and articulation of their solution. This means how well was the team able to communicate their target audience, problems they are solving and how their product is the solution to that problem.</li>

                   <label>What are the roles of a mentor?</label>
                   <p>The role of a "Tech" or "Business" mentor is to be floating resources for the duration of the hackathon. This means helping teams define workflow, brainstorm ideas, problem solve and develop the final presentation. Mentors are free to communicate amongst themselves on questions of observations that occur. As organizers, we would be glad to gain some insight on technical issues, hackathon dynamics, or other Bison Hacks materials. Here are a few pointers to keep in mind as a Bison Hacks mentor:</p>
                   <ul>
                     <li><b>Be available for participants.</b> Participants will contact mentors that they believe will be able to address their questions. Responding to teams questions is not a 24/7 responsibility, but please do check the communication channels and get back to the participants in a reasonable time frame. Within the Eventbrite link, there are 4-hour time slots, that mentors can choose.</li>
                     <li><b>Offer what you know.</b> It is best to acknowledge that you are not well-versed in the subject than to point teams down a sub-optimal path. If you are unable to answer the question it is fine giving the team some online resources or refer them to another mentor that may specialize in the area of interest.</li>
                     <li><b>You are a mentor.</b> It may be tempting but mentors are not allowed to join or contribute to a team. That includes writing a few lines of code or writing a couple bullets on their pitch decks. Providing pointers, references to examples and advice about design concepts are all in-bounds of the role of a mentor.</li>
                     <li><b>Share questions and answers.</b> Bison Hacks is a learning hackathon and we feel that every team can benefit from questions asked and answered on team-to-mentor interactions. We strongly encourage to summarize questions/answers for posting to the whole group of participants. As we approach the kick-off date, the Bison Hacks Team will announce how information can be shared amongst participants and how mentors should publish to the communication channels.</li>
