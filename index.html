    <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
    <p>A hackathon is a weekend long event where you go all the way from idea to prototype. At the end of bisonhacks, you will pitch your app, website, or whatever prototype you dreamed up, and compete for prizes! Hackathons are a great place to learn quickly and create something awesome.</p>
    <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
    <p>Bisonhacks is completely free for all registered participants! The food is free, and all the awesome swag is free.</p>
    <h4>Will there be food?</h4>
    <p>Absolutely! We have four delicious meals planned with plenty of snacks in between to keep you going for 24 hours.</p>
    <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
    <p>Bring you, your computer, computer charger, toiletries (toothbrush and toothpaste), and anything else for your hack.</p>
    <h4>This is my first hackathon!</h4>
    <p>You're more than welcome at bisonhacks! We will have workshops during the event and mentors to help you through any troubles. So, no matter what your skill level is, we will provide the resources to help you learn.</p>
    <h4>Do you have a code of conduct?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Check out <a href = https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf> MLH's Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
    <h4>Who can attend this hackathon?</h4>
    <p>Bison Hacks is open to Howard University students and anyone who is 18 years or older (we will be checking ID) and is currently enrolled in college or university with a valid student ID. International students are invited to apply and attend, but we cannot guarantee full travel reimbursement.</p>
    <h4>Are walk-ins welcomed?</h4>
    <p>Due to the location we are only allowed to have attendees who have registered for the hackathon. Therefore, if you are interested attending this event please register at this <a href = https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bisonhacks-howard-university-hackathon-tickets-43081236137>link</a>.</p>
    <h4>Are graduate students welcomed to attend?</h4>
    <p>Howard University graduate students are welcomed to register for this hackathon.</p>
    <h4>I am interested in being a mentor; how do I sign up to be one?</h4>
    <p>That is great! We welcome any help! To sign up as a mentor you can simply select "Mentor" on the form within the registration <a href = https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bisonhacks-howard-university-hackathon-tickets-43081236137#tickets>link </a>here.</p>
    <h4>Do I have to have a technological background in order to be a mentor?</h4>
    <p>Although it is ideal, but it is not a requirement. We welcome anyone who have experience in entrepreneurship, marketing, finance and technology.</p>
    <h4>What are the roles of a mentor?</h4>
    <p>The role of a "Tech" or "Business" mentor is to be floating resources for the duration of the hackathon. This means helping teams define workflow, brainstorm ideas, problem solve and develop the final presentation. Mentors are free to communicate amongst themselves on questions of observations that occur. As organizers, we would be glad to gain some insight on technical issues, hackathon dynamics, or other Bison Hacks materials. Here are a few pointers to keep in mind as a Bison Hacks mentor: </p>
<LI><b>Be available for participants. </b>Participants will contact mentors that they believe will be able to address their questions. Responding to teams’ questions is not a 24/7 responsibility, but please do check the communication channels and get back to the participants in a reasonable time frame. Within the Eventbrite link, there are 4-hour time slots, that mentors can choose.</LI>
<LI><b>Offer what you know. </b>It is best to acknowledge that you are not well-versed in the subject than to point teams down a sub-optimal path. If you are unable to answer the question it is fine giving the team some online resources or refer them to another mentor that may specialize in the area of interest.</LI>
<LI><b>You are a mentor. </b>It may be tempting but mentors are not allowed to join or contribute to a team. That includes writing a few lines of code or writing a couple bullets on their pitch decks. Providing pointers, references to examples and advice about design concepts are all in-bounds of the role of a mentor.</LI>
<LI><b>Share questions and answers. </b>Bison Hacks is a learning hackathon and we feel that every team can benefit from questions asked and answered on team-to-mentor interactions. We strongly encourage to summarize questions/answers for posting to the whole group of participants. As we approach the kick-off date, the Bison Hacks Team will announce how information can be shared amongst participants and how mentors should publish to the communication channels.</LI>

<b>Impact. </b>Our theme this year is to create a solution that will help improve the betterment of the DMV community. In this category we are looking for key factors that shows how the team's idea is scalable and give a clear measure as to how thier solution makes an impact on the user's life.<br>
      <b>Technical. </b>In the midst of the given 24 hours the judges will be looking for an established <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>minimum viable product </a>and a <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype>working prototype. </a>This can range from a web application, mobile application or an iot.<br>
<b>Design and User Experience. </b>The teams final minimum viable product and prototype should achieve an engaging and memorable user experience. This means having a clear interface that is intuitive for users that come from different backgrounds.<br>
<b>Presentation. </b>Teams will be rated base off presentation layout and articulation of their solution. This means how well was the team able to communicate their target audience, problems they are solving and how their product is the solution to that problem.</p>
